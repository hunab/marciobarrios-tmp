This is a temporaty site I created to force me to redesign my portfolio, because it's too old and it's outdated.

To build this minisite I used CSS3 animations, transforms, gradients... and mediaqueries to adapt to different resolutions (especially iPhone).

It's not finished, I need to solve some cross-browser issues and improve it.
